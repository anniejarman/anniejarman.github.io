      <p style="font-size:0.8em;">Women politicians report that social media abuse harms their personal and professional lives. However, prior text-based research finds that men receive more general online hostility than women—except among the most visible politicians. I hypothesize that backlash to perceived gender role violations - such as public visibility - will include distinctly gendered content, such as slurs and references to appearance. Using a novel and replicable method, I analyze hostile and gendered language in three million Twitter mentions of US state representatives. I find that hostility toward visible women differs from men in content, not volume. Visible women face similar volumes of generic hostility but twice as much gender-specific abuse as men. This pattern holds across two alternate measures of perceived conformity to traditional gender roles: legislator tone and the presence of women in the chamber. Incorporating gendered content into text-based analyses reconciles discrepancies between observational and self-reported data and validates women politicians' reports.</p>

      <p style="font-size:0.8em;"> This paper addresses whether the disproportionate abuse women politicians receive online decreases their political ambition. By pairing a novel method of distinguishing gendered hostility from general hostility in tweets directed to politicians with hand-collected panel data on the career decisions of 1,247 U.S. state legislators across four election cycles, I shed new light on the conventional wisdom. Contrary to the widespread expectation that online hostility drives incumbent women from politics, I show that women’s political ambition is resilient to gendered hostility. Although women politicians receive more severe and gender-based online hostility than men, they are less likely than men to exit office in response. These findings suggest a gender-based selection effect, where only the most thick-skinned women pursue political office.</p>
